- Svelte prefers snake_case
- No dynamic element (yet https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/5481)
- computeds ($:) are ðŸ”¥
- BlockNavigation is overcomplicated - most of 'styles' is overriden anyway
- SCSS is not working
- weird nav underline issue
- weird recalculation of nav styling

todo:
- head
- ?merge Dom branch and rebuild CSS + navigation
- socials

- updated json structure
- template switch with window.postMessage
- deploy
